# Adventist Hymnarium

An iOS application for accessing Seventh-day Adventist hymns and sheet music.

## Project Structure

This repository contains only the essential project files:

- `src/` - Main iOS application source code
- `adventist-hymnarium-tests/` - Unit tests
- `adventist-hymnarium-uitests/` - UI tests

## Required Resources (Not in Repository)

The application requires additional resources that are not tracked in the repository. These must be obtained separately:

### Firebase Configuration
The app uses Firebase for analytics, remote configuration, and storage. You'll need to:
1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Add an iOS app to your Firebase project
3. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` configuration file
4. Place it in the project root directory
   - Note: A template file `GoogleService-Info.template.plist` is provided as reference
5. Set up Firebase Storage for hymn audio and sheet music files
   - Audio files should be organized by hymnal year (e.g. "1985/001.mp3")
   - Sheet music PDFs should follow the same structure (e.g. "1985/001.pdf")

### Data Files
Place these JSON files in `src/Resources/Assets/`:
- `new-hymnal-en.json` - Data for the 1985 hymnal
- `new-hymnal-thematic-list-en.json` - Thematic index for 1985 hymnal
- `old-hymnal-en.json` - Data for the 1941 hymnal
- `old-hymnal-thematic-list-en.json` - Thematic index for 1941 hymnal
- `responsive_readings.json` - Responsive readings
