# Adventist Hymnarium

An iOS application for accessing Seventh-day Adventist hymns and sheet music.

## Project Structure

This repository contains:

- `src/` - Main iOS application source code
  - `Models/` - Data models for hymns, readings, and app configuration
  - `Services/` - Core services for hymn and reading management
  - `Views/` - SwiftUI views for the user interface
  - `Resources/` - Application resources and assets
- `adventist-hymnarium-tests/` - Unit tests

## Required Resources (Not in Repository)

The application requires additional resources that are not tracked in the repository. These must be obtained separately:

### Cloud Storage
The app requires cloud storage for hymn audio and sheet music files. You can use any cloud storage provider (e.g., Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, etc.). Files should be organized as follows:
- Audio files by hymnal year (e.g. "1985/001.mp3")
- Sheet music PDFs following the same structure (e.g. "1985/001.pdf")

### Firebase Configuration
The app uses Firebase for analytics and remote configuration. You'll need to:
1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Add an iOS app to your Firebase project
3. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` configuration file
4. Place it in the project root directory
   - Note: A template file `GoogleService-Info.template.plist` is provided as reference
